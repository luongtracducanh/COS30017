# Layouts

There are two layouts in this app: one using LinearLayout and one using ConstraintLayout.

LinearLayout is pretty simple to use -- it doesn't do much in the way of fancy stuff but for a couple of views it usually suffices.

For something more flexible, ConstraintLayout is the way to go. This is the default layout. new_layout.xml is an example of this -- a video showing how it was set up can be found in Canvas.

The key things to remember with ConstraintLayout is top, bottom, start (the left of the widget) and end (the right side of the widget). A sketch is sometimes handy.
