<h1>Converting from decimal to binary</h1>
<p>The process for converting from decimal to binary can be done in several ways.

<p>One algorithm is to repeatedly divide the binary value by 2 until zero is reached,
        keeping track of the remainder each time.

<p>For example, converting 43 to binary leads to:
    <ul><li>43 / 2 = 21 remainder 1</li>
    <li>21 / 2 = 10 remainder 1</li>
<li>10 / 2 = 5 remainder 0</li>
<li>5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1</li>
<li>2 / 2 = 1 remainder 0</li>
<li>1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1</li>
</ul>

<p>So reading from the bottom up, 43 in binary is 101011. We can check this by converting back,
    recalling that we start numbering positions at 0 from right to left: 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> +
    2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = 1 + 2 + 8 + 32 = 43.
